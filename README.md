# TaxiAndBusCompany
Old IT school 3-weeks project (in 2005). My very first java project.

Please be tolerant. This is the ugliest code chunk I will ever write in my career.

The MonGUI class is the octopus class of this program.
The other classes are there to experiment some features of Java such as inheritance or polymorphism.
